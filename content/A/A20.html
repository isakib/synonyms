meaning occurence of some command. To be new,or birth of some new matter
or thing. and as per ibn ul faris KAUN ALSHAYEE LAM YAKUN(كون الشَي لَم

existent before and HADDACA meaning to tell someone about such a matter
which one doesn't know or atleast that's what the person telling
assumes. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - سورة البقرة <br>

when they meet those who believe, they say, "We have believed"; but
when they are alone with one another, they say, "Do you talk to them
about what Allah has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it
before your Lord?"</b> Then will you not reason? <br> </font> <br> <br> <b>20.6 3RRAFA( عَرَّفَ )</b>:
so 3ARAFA(عَرَفَ) means to acquaint with something by pondering and
analyzing it's signs and clues. and its obvious that a person might be
mistaken some times thus level of acquaintance is lesser than 3LM
(knowledge). antonym of acquaintance is denial. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Yūsuf (Joseph) - سورة يوسف <br>
12:58 <br>
وَجَاءَ إِخْوَةُ يُوسُفَ فَدَخَلُوا عَلَيْهِ<b> فَعَرَفَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ مُنكِرُونَ</b> <br>
And the brothers of Joseph came [seeking food], and they entered upon him; <b>and he recognized them, but he was to them unknown. </b></font><br> <br>
then 3ARAFA means to wear fragrance and 3ARRAFA meaning to perfumed with fragrance and also to release fragrance.<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Muĥammad (Muhammad) - سورة محمد <br>
47:6 <br> <b>وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ </b><b><br>
And admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them. </b></font><br> <br>
Imam raghib has translated above as "and ALLAH has perfumed paradise for them with fragrance" <br> <br> <b>20.7 ATLA3(أَطلع)</b>:TL3(طلع)
basic meaning is to appear, and come in front of. and TL3 ALKAWAKIB()
meaning rise of planets,sun and moon etc. and ATLA3 meaning to
familiarise someone with reality of the situation. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat 'Āli `Imrān (Family of Imran) - سورة آل عمران <br>
3:179 <br>
مَّا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيَذَرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَىٰ مَا أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّىٰ يَمِيزَ الْخَبِيثَ مِنَ الطَّيِّبِ ۗ <b>وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُطْلِعَكُمْ عَلَى الْغَيْبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَجْتَبِي مِن رُّسُلِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۖ</b> فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ۚ وَإِن تُؤْمِنُوا وَتَتَّقُوا فَلَكُمْ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ <br>
Allah would not leave the believers in that [state] you are in [presently] until He separates the evil from the good. <b>Nor would Allah reveal to you the unseen. But [instead], Allah chooses of His messengers whom He wills,</b> so believe in Allah and His messengers. And if you believe and fear Him, then for you is a great reward. <br>
</font> <br> <br> <b>20.8 ANBA-A and NABBAA(أَنبَا نَبَّا)</b>: NABA basic meaning is to arrive from one place to another<br>
and SALUN NABYUN(سيلٌ نَابيٌ) meaning such a flood which arrives from
one city to another.then on that basis NABA was being used in the
meaning of KHABAR. difference between KHABAR and NABA is that KHABAR is
common and NABA is for some special event which is also beneficial for
the listener.moreover NABA refers to past,present,future,or even
metaphysic meaning news of afterlife and resurrection as well. whereas
KHABAR is limited to past and present. so importance ,benefit,and
vastness of time these three things make NABA more prominent than
KHABAR. as NABA includes news of future or forecast .based on this
disbeliever used to call Prophets as soothsayers. <br> <br>
Imam raghib defines NABA as it excludes lies and from this knowledge of
beneficial assumption as from divine revelation and continuous news but
in my opinion this condition is not true because ALLAH said:<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Ĥujurāt (The Rooms) - سورة الحجرات <br>
49:6 <br> <b>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن جَاءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا </b>أَن تُصِيبُوا قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ فَتُصْبِحُوا عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ <br> <b>O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate</b>, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful. <br>
</font><br>
It is obvious from this that in NABA of FASIQ there is chance of
Flasehood that's why ALLAH had commanded for investigation. like wise
when hoopoe gave news (NABA ) to Solomon (AS) then he doesn't obtain any
3LM or beneficial assumption out of it <br> <br> <b>20.9 DALL(دلّ)</b>: meaning to give guidance ,or to show path,to tell address of some thing and <b>reasoning</b>
meaning from which familiarity of something is attained like ,words
reason with meaning. or like when something moves then person
understands that this thing is a living thing.so like movement reasons
with life of living thing. and DALL has both physical and abstract
context. ALLAH said <br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Ţāhā (Ta-Ha) - سورة طه <br>
20:40 <br> <b>إِذْ تَمْشِي أُخْتُكَ فَتَقُولُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ مَن يَكْفُلُهُ</b>
