ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ
حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَاتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ
أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ
الْعَالَمِينَ <br> <b>Indeed, your Lord is Allah , who created the heavens and earth in six days</b>
and then established Himself above the Throne. He covers the night with
the day, [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun,
the moon, and the stars, subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His
is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah , Lord of the worlds. <br> </font> <br>

and Skies ,can not be imagined to be that day which results from sun's
existence<br> <br> <b>3.5 YAUM AL B3S(يَُوم البعث)</b>: B3S meaning to
