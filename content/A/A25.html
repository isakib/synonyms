25.1 JAA-(JEE-)((جَاء(جِئ):</b> It is generally used for 'coming' . but it is necessary that the act of coming had taken place. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Yūsuf (Joseph) - سورة يوسف <br>
12:16 <b><br>
وَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَاءً يَبْكُونَ </b><b><br>
And they came to their father at night, weeping. </b><br> </font> <br> <br> <b>25.2 ATAA( اَتَي)</b>:
meaning to come as result of some event/process or come with ease like
churning milk results in butter ATUWWA( اَتُوّة) and AATI(إِتِي) is
flood<br>
the difference between JAA- and ATAA is that in ATAA it is not necessary
that the act of coming had taken place. as in the ayah below<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat An-Naĥl (The Bee) - سورة النحل <br>
16:1 <br> <b>أَتَىٰ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ</b> ۚ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ <br> <b>The command of Allah is coming, so be not impatient for it</b>. Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him. </font><br>
<br>
the command of Allah in above ayah refers to Judgement day which is yet to happen<br> <br> <b>25.3 HYTA(هَيْتَ)</b>:This word is used as 2nd person command of AATA which changes with the attached pronoun HYTA LAKA(هَيْتَ لَكَ)<br>
HYTA LAKUMA(هَيْتَ لَكُمَا)<br>
HYTA LAKUM(هَيْتَ لَكُمْ).<br>
Ibne Faris said that HYTA refers to shouting. some said that it means to come here,come there,come quickly. In the Quran<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Yūsuf (Joseph) - سورة يوسف <br>
12:23 <br>

وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا
