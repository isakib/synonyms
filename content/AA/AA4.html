يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا<b> وَمَا يَنزِلُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيهَا</b> ۖ وَهُوَ مَعَكُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ <br>

established Himself above the Throne. He knows what penetrates into the
earth and what emerges from it<b> and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein</b>; and He is with you wherever you are. And Allah , of what you do, is Seeing. <br> </font> <br>

BIHI(نَزَلَ بِهِ). and for angels and divine commandments descend both
these words are used. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Ash-Shu`arā' (The Poets) - سورة الشعراء <br>

4.1.1 NAZALA common word, TANAZZAL used for divine revelation and commandment , and satanic revelation etc<br>
4.1.2 HALLA to descend upon a place<br>
4.1.3 HABATA involuntarily or forcibly descending ,falling or emerging from a place<br> <br> <b><u> UTA</u><u>A</u><u>RNA</u><br>
4.2Synonyms: ANZAL (from NAZAL) and NAZZALA, AHALLA (from HALLA) and also WADA3 and KHALA3<br> <br>
4.2.1 ANZALA(انزَلَ) and NAZZALA(نَزَّلَ)</b>: some scholars thinks that word ANZALA is use to send downs something from height at once. as ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Qadr (The Power) - سورة القدر <br>
97:1 <b><br>
إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ <br>
Indeed, We sent the Qur'an down during the Night of Decree. </b></font><br> <br>
and it's obvious that Quran was not sent down at one . it's explaination
is that Quran was sent down on Heaven of this word at once in that
night. and then later on as per the occassion and need was sent down via
revealation. second explaination is that (Fateh Muhammad Saheb)
translated this ayah as " we have revealed this (Quran) in Night of QADR
(start it) and TANZEEL means to send down something gradually or as per
the need as ;<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Furqān (The Criterian) - سورة الفرقان <br>
25:1 <b><br>
تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ</b> لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَالَمِينَ نَذِيرًا <br> <b>Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion upon His Servant</b> that he may be to the worlds a warner - <br> </font> <br>
so Imam Raghib also shares this view point. he said "The literal
difference between the two is that TANZEEL means some thing send down
once and then after and differently. and ANZAAL is common word tat
referes to something send down at once completely".<br>
so as per Imam Raghib ,TANZEEL refers to gradual and ANZAAL refers to
gradual and at once both. send down. but Quran doesn't confirm that for
e.g.<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Furqān (The Criterian) - سورة الفرقان <br>
25:32 <br> <b>وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْلَا نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الْقُرْآنُ جُمْلَةً وَاحِدَةً</b> ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ لِنُثَبِّتَ بِهِ فُؤَادَكَ ۖ وَرَتَّلْنَاهُ تَرْتِيلًا <br> <b>And those who disbelieve say, "Why was the Qur'an not revealed to him all at once?"</b> Thus [it is] that We may strengthen thereby your heart. And We have spaced it distinctly. </font><br>
<br>
here for TANZEEL is used to mean "at once"<br>
and in reality these two words are so near in meaning that one can be
informally used in place of other. only as per Limitation of words and
explaination of sentence any of them is used by Quran.<br> <br> <b>4.2.2 AAHALLA(اَحَلَّ)</b>:
to send down some one from one place to another. this results because
of some deed of the one descending. and it can be for both good and bad.

a) For Good<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Fāţir (Originator) - سورة فاطر <br>
35:34 <b><br>
وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا الْحَزَنَ ۖ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ </b><b><br>

35:35 <br> <b>الَّذِي أَحَلَّنَا دَارَ الْمُقَامَةِ مِن فَضْلِهِ</b> لَا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَلَا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا لُغُوبٌ <br> <b>He who has settled us in the home of duration out of His bounty</b>. There touches us not in it any fatigue, and there touches us not in it weariness [of mind]." </font><br>

O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess and
those who have not [yet] reached puberty among you ask permission of you
[before entering] at three times: before the dawn prayer<b> and when you put aside your clothing [for rest] at noon</b>
and after the night prayer. [These are] three times of privacy for you.
There is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these [periods], for
they continually circulate among you - some of you, among others. Thus
does Allah make clear to you the verses; and Allah is Knowing and Wise.</font> <br> <br> <br> <b>4.2.4 KHALA3A(خَلَعَ)</b>: basic meaning is to separate something which was included before in it<br>
word KHULA3(خُلع) gives the same meaning that a woman takes separation
from husband by giving of money in return. and Divorce happens. In the
Holy Quran this word is used to take off shoes from feet . ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Ţāhā (Ta-Ha) - سورة طه <br>
