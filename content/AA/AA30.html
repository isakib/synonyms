Synonyms: AHAZA,WAHYD,FARD,FRADA<br> <br>
30.1 AHAD(احد)</b>:meaning ,one of a kind,unique. From this point of
view it can only relate to ALLAH ,for other than ALLAH, WAHID(وَاحِد) is
used.but on two occassion AHAD is used as synonym to WAHID a) Counting
numbers and their arrangement as ( اَحَدَ عَشَرَ اَحَدَهُمَ احدٌ
منكم،احدكم،يوم الاحد) etc b) for negation only for intellectual being .
as LAYSA FI ADDAR AHADUN(لَيْسَ فِي الدّارِ اَحَدٌ) meaning there is no
one in the house . In the Quran<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Ĥāqqah (The Reality) - سورة الحاقة <br>

and WAHID is a common word . and can be used for everyone and ALLAH. as
one of ALLAH's name whose meaning is (هُوَ الّلهُ الوَاحِدُ
الْقَهَّارُ). but when we say<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-'Ikhlāş (The Sincerity) - سورة الإخلاص <br>
112:1 <b><br>

30.2 WAHYD(وَحِيْد)</b>: compared with AHAD something which is alone
,one and unqiue from creation. for it WAHID and WAHYD both words are
used. like ASSHAMSU WAHIDATUN(أَلشَمسُ وَاحِدَةٌ) sun is one or FULANUN
WAHIDU 3ASRIHI(فُلاَنٌ وَاحِدُ عصرِهِ) that person is authority of
(some subject or skill) the time[like a living legend]. and WAHYD is
used in those meanings . in the Quran<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Muddaththir (The Cloaked One) - سورة المدثر <br>
