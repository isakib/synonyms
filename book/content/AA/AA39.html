آبَاؤُنَا وَلَا حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَيْءٍ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن
قَبْلِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ ذَاقُوا بَأْسَنَا ۗ قُلْ هَلْ عِندَكُم مِّنْ عِلْمٍ

not have associated [anything] and neither would our fathers, nor would
we have prohibited anything." Likewise did those before deny until they
tasted Our punishment. Say, "Do you have any knowledge that you can
produce for us? <b>You follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying</b>." <br> </font> <br> <br> <b>39.2 QADDARA( قَدَّرَ)</b>:QADARA(قَدَرَ)
