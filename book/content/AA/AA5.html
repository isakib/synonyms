Synonyms: FAREHA,BATARA,MARAHA,IKHTAAL,<wbr>FAKHARA,AASHARA,TAMAT TA,TAKABBARA,FAREhA</b><br> <br> <b>5.1 FAREHA(فَرِحَ)</b>: is used in two ways FAREHA ALQALB(فَرِحَ القَلب) and FAREHA ALNAFS(فَرِحَ النفس) <br>
FAREHA ALQALB means to be thankful on some blessing from the bottom of heart. this is a commendable attribute ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Yūnus (Jonah) - سورة يونس <br>
10:58 <b><br>
قُلْ بِفَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَبِذَٰلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُوا هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ </b><b><br>
Say, "In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; it is better than what they accumulate." </b></font><br> <br>
FAREHA ALNAFS is a deplorble attribute meaning rather than being
grateful to ALLAH's blessings,indulgence in haughtiness,and vanity and
to rejoice. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Qaşaş (The Stories) - سورة القصص <br>
28:76 <br>
إِنَّ قَارُونَ كَانَ مِن قَوْمِ مُوسَىٰ فَبَغَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ۖ
وَآتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْكُنُوزِ مَا إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوءُ
بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُولِي الْقُوَّةِ<b> إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ قَوْمُهُ لَا تَفْرَحْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ</b> <br>
Indeed, Qarun was from the people of Moses, but he tyrannized them. And
We gave him of treasures whose keys would burden a band of strong men; <b>thereupon his people said to him, "Do not exult. Indeed, Allah does not like the exultant. </b><br> </font> <br> <br> <b>5.2 BATARA(بَطَرَ)</b>:
To stray owing to excessive blessing ,and as per Imam Raghib BATARA is
like a terror which disesased a person owing to misuse of
prosperity,negligence in right of blessing and misuse of blessing. and
as per Ibn Faris it means to tear apart (over inflated) . like excessive
blessing have caused somebody to have their eyes bulge out and thus
they are arrogant. so BATAR includes in its meaning Excessive blessing,
ungratefulness,and misuse . it is the next level of FAREHA. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Qaşaş (The Stories) - سورة القصص <br>
28:58 <br> <b>وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ بَطِرَتْ مَعِيشَتَهَا ۖ</b> فَتِلْكَ مَسَاكِنُهُمْ لَمْ تُسْكَن مِّن بَعْدِهِمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا ۖ وَكُنَّا نَحْنُ الْوَارِثِينَ <br> <b>And how many a city have We destroyed that was insolent in its [way of] living</b>, and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly. And it is We who were the inheritors.</font> <br>
<br> <b>5.3 MARAHA(مَرَحَ)</b>: to sway out of joy, SHIDDAT ULFAREH(شِدّةُ الفَرِحَ) . to walk with pomp and show. This is the third level , ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-'Isrā' (The Night Journey) - سورة الإسراء <br>
17:37 <br> <b>وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا ۖ إِنَّكَ لَن تَخْرِقَ الْأَرْضَ وَلَن تَبْلُغَ الْجِبَالَ طُولًا </b><b><br>
And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear
the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height. </b><br> </font> <br> <br> <b>5.4 IKHTAAL( اِختَال)</b>:
KHYL(خيل) as per Ibn Faris KHYL means YDL 3LA HARKAH FI TALAWWUN(يدل
علي حركة في تَلَوّن). meaning that movement which changes style every
moment. TAKHYYUL( تَخيّل) meaning to imagine, to be arrogant, and
IKHTAAL meaning to walk proudly and to pace arrogantly. so such a
person's mind is above the level of common people and this is the next
leve from MARAHA<br> <br> <b>5.5 FAKHR(فَخَر)</b>: to boast on those
matters which are beyond one's capacity and authority. for e.g. arrogant
on lineage, or inherited wealth. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Luqmān (Luqman) - سورة لقمان <br>
31:18 <b><br>
وَلَا تُصَعِّرْ خَدَّكَ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ </b><b><br>
And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people and do not walk
through the earth exultantly. Indeed, Allah does not like everyone
self-deluded and boastful. </b><br> </font> <br>
in this ayah ALLAH have described all of three attributes of MARAHA , IKHTAAL and FAKHARA in order. <br> <br> <b>5.6 AASHARA(اَشَرَ) AASHIRUN(اَشِرٌ)</b>:
is said to such a self-centred person who in addition to all the above
mentioned attributes also brag and boast. as per Imam Raghib ALASHR(
الاشر) means to be to much arrogant . so this is next level beyond
MARAHA and IKHTAAL. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Qamar (The Moon) - سورة القمر <br>
54:26 <b><br>
سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَدًا مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الْأَشِرُ </b><b><br>
