مِّنْهُم مَّن كَلَّمَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَاتٍ ۚ
وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ

وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُوا مِن قَبْلُ لَفِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ <br> <b>Certainly did Allah confer [great] favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves</b>,

وَإِذْ تَقُولُ لِلَّذِي أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَأَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْسِكْ عَلَيْكَ زَوْجَكَ</b>
وَاتَّقِ اللَّهَ وَتُخْفِي فِي نَفْسِكَ مَا اللَّهُ مُبْدِيهِ وَتَخْشَى
النَّاسَ وَاللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَاهُ ۖ فَلَمَّا قَضَىٰ زَيْدٌ
مِّنْهَا وَطَرًا زَوَّجْنَاكَهَا لِكَيْ لَا يَكُونَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ
حَرَجٌ فِي أَزْوَاجِ أَدْعِيَائِهِمْ إِذَا قَضَوْا مِنْهُنَّ وَطَرًا ۚ
وَكَانَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ مَفْعُولًا <br> <b>And [remember, O Muhammad], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor, "Keep your wife </b>and
fear Allah ," while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is
to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that
you fear Him. So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married
her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort
concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need
of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished. <br> </font> <br> <b><br>

whether it relates to oneself or others. in Hadith of Jibreel(AS),He
asked Muhammad(PBUH)what is AHSAAN so he replied "AHSAAN is that you
worship ALLAH like that you are watching HIM and if that's not
attainable then to atleast think that ALLAH is watching you". AHSAAN is
used for smaller of the smallest an larger of the largest of goodness.

حَقًّا ۖ <b>وَقَدْ أَحْسَنَ بِي إِذْ أَخْرَجَنِي مِنَ السِّجْنِ وَجَاءَ بِكُم مِّنَ الْبَدْوِ </b>مِن
بَعْدِ أَن نَّزَغَ الشَّيْطَانُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ إِخْوَتِي ۚ إِنَّ
رَبِّي لَطِيفٌ لِّمَا يَشَاءُ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ <br>
