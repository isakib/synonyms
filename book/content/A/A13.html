ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوا إِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبَا ۗ
وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَا ۚ فَمَن جَاءَهُ
مَوْعِظَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ فَانتَهَىٰ فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى
اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا
خَالِدُونَ <br> <b>Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day
of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into
insanity.</b> That is because they say, "Trade is [just] like interest."
But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever
has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is
past, and his affair rests with Allah . But whoever returns to [dealing
in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will
abide eternally therein. <br> </font><br>
