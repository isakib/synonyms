Mutaradifaat al Qur’an Translated files
==========================================
NOTE: All the translated content received from translator volunteers are split-up by Topic and each one is individually saved as a html file within its Topic letter folder, all inside the content folder.
To browse the different topics, you just need to open each folder and double click the html files.
Reviewers can make edits/corrections/changes to the HTML file (using their favorite html editor) and then send back the file. This file will be checked-in overwriting the previous article. Since we use a source version control system, all changes are tracked automatically and can be reverted back to any time.

Example: To see the first entry under Alif-mamdooah, open the "A" (alif) folder, and then double click A1.html. 
To see 22nd entry under Alif-maqsoorah, open "AA" folder and double click AA22.html.
